## DRL_Training

Here are some deep reinforcement learning implementations using OpenAi gym's environment. Pytorch is used to build a neural network.

### MountainCar-v0

Deep-Q Network (DQN) and Double Deep-Q Network(DDQN) implementations. Struggle to train the agent using default reward, as the agent fails to record success with random moves. Thus changing the reward based on the distance the agent moves, and it converges quite quickly.
